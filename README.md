# Musical User Interfaces

Code for the prototypes in the set of essays [*Musical User Interfaces*](http://arthurcarabott.com/mui/).

## A Request

This is prototype code, it is not production code. If you like this project, please build on the **ideas** and **not the code**. The prototypes exists to test and help communicate the ideas, not as a technical foundation.

These projects were designed and built in 8 weeks, along with two other projects ([Konnakkol](http://arthurcarabott.com/konnakkol/) and a [loop pedal for Bela](https://github.com/acarabott/bela-looper/)) while also writing a dissertation and trying to explore Los Angeles. Seriously, it's prototype code.

I am putting the code online because enough people asked for it, not because I want people to fork and use it.

## Another request

Please build on these ideas! Whether you are a hobbyist of a *serious commercial audio company*, I invite you to use them in your projects. Credit and citations are a nice courtesy, and please drop me a line if you do make something [arthur@arthurcarabott.com](mailto:arthur@arthurcarabott.com).

If you do happen to be from a *serious commercial audio company* and need some form of legal clearance then just e-mail me...
